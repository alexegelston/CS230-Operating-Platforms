# CS230-Operating-Platforms
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based version of their gaming app Draw it or Lose it. Currently The Gaming Room only has an android app developed for their game. The app pulls an image from a library and is slowly rendered over 30 seconds. If the team does not guess the puzzle by 30 seconds, then the other teams each have 15 seconds to guess the puzzle. The game in total lasts 4 rounds at 1 minute per round. I did a good job in the design template of outlining the pros and cons of each operating platform selected for analysis. Working through the design document allowed me better perspective in how to approach the code for this project. If I were to go back and revise my work I would focus more on the development requirments and evaluation sections of the template with better detail. I interpreted the user's need of adaptability for the development team to write code into the software design as recommending using the Windows operating platform. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing to optimize time and resources spent developing. The best appproach to designing software for me is to write out what I need to work in a flow-chart. This helps me to see overall how things should work to meet every design requirement.
